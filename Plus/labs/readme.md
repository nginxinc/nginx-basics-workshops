These Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to be independent, with later labs adding additional services and features as you progress through them. Completing the labs in sequential order is highly recommended.

By the end of this Workshop, you will have a working, operational NGINX Plus Docker test environment, routing traffic to and from backend web application servers, with the necessary skills to deploy and operate NGINX for your own Modern Applications. Thank You for taking the time to attend this NGINXpert Workshop!
